\item {\bf Matrix-matrix multiplication.}  We will experiment with a simple
implementation of a matrix-matrix multiplication, which you can download from
the \texttt{homework1} directory in \url{https://github.com/NYU-HPC19/}. We will
improve and extend this implementation throughout the semester. For now, let us
just assess the performance of this basic function. Report the processor you use
for your timings. For code compiled with different optimization flags
(\texttt{-O0} and \texttt{-O3}) and for various (large) matrix sizes, report
\begin{itemize}
\item the flop rate,
\item and the rate of memory access.
\end{itemize}
